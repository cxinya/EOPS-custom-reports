# EOPS-custom-reports

This was an app I built for the Physician Assistant Education Assocation (PAEA). It creates customized reports on-demand for any of 230+ PA programs, summarizing their own students' responses to the End of Program Survey. These custom reports incentivized programs to boost student participation while also functioning as a tool for benchmarking, evaluation, and accreditation.

No real program names or IDs are included.
